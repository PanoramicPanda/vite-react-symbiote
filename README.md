# TaleSpire Symbiote Base with Vite + React

This project serves as a base for creating Symbiotes for TaleSpire using Vite and React. It provides a streamlined setup to get you started quickly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

### Project Setup

This project was set up using the command:

```sh
npm create vite@latest . --template react
```

If you're picking up this project, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PanoramicPanda/vite-react-symbiote.git
   cd vite-react-symbiote
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The development environment is configured to match the Symbiote's width (599px) for accurate styling and layout.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the production build of your Symbiote.

### Deployment

Running the deploy_to_ts script will copy the build to the default locally installed Symbiotes folder based on your OS.

1. **Update Symbiote Name:**

   Ensure you update the `symbioteName` variable in the deploy_to_ts script to match your Symbiote's folder name.

2. **Run Deploy Script:**

   ```sh
   npm run deploy
   ```

For more information on Symbiote installation paths, refer to the [Symbiote installation documentation](https://symbiote-docs.talespire.com/#installing).

### Manifest Configuration

The `manifest.json` file located in the `public` folder includes basic configuration for your Symbiote, such as name, website, and authors.

**Note:** This manifest does not include the TaleSpire API hooks. For detailed documentation on the manifest configuration, visit [Symbiote Manifest Documentation](https://symbiote-docs.talespire.com/manifest_doc_v1.html).

### Ensuring Listener Functions Are Not Minified

When working with functions that are intended to be listeners on subscriptions in your project, it's crucial to ensure these functions are not minified during the build process. This ensures that their names remain intact and can be correctly referenced.
Steps to Prevent Minification

#### Update vite.config.js:
   
   Configure Vite to use Terser and specify the functions you want to keep non-minified. Add the following configuration to your vite.config.js:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
   plugins: [react()],
   build: {
      minify: 'terser',
      terserOptions: {
         keep_fnames: /oneFunctionNameToKeep|otherFunctionNamesToKeep/
      }
   }
});
```

In the terserOptions, replace otherFunctionNamesToKeep with any other function names you want to keep non-minified.

### Notes

- The project uses JavaScript (JS) instead of TypeScript (TS).
- SVG files are not supported in Symbiotes; please use PNG files instead.
- Update your project name in the `package.json` file.
